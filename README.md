# Paradise Lost Crawler

Crawls the content of the more than excellent Dartmouth "The John Milton Reading Room", including the text annotations.
It also converts them into a ready to use tex-formatted version, which allows to easily create a pdf for !PERSONAL USE!.

There are still some "bugs"/missing features, such as specially formatting block-quotes in annotation. Thats future (TM) work...
Currently you need to manually fix four erros in the tex files, takes about 20 seconds :).

# Todo
- [ ] Alternative (=modern) spelling (e.g., as "furigana" using ruby)
- [ ] Incorrectly crawled annotations (double, probably due to timing issues with dynamic elements)
- [ ] Deal with block quotes in annotations
- [ ] Deal with links (internally and externally)
- [ ] Improved tex template
